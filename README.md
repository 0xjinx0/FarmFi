# FarmFi - 👨‍🌾 The protocol for farmers to get richer faster 👩‍🌾
Developed by <APU Team, insert name if we want> for the Algorand Reach Hackathon Team Project 2022.

## What is FarmFi? 🐔
Being a derivative from DeFi (Decentralized Financial), FarmFi serves to provide farmers the opportunity to earn more by controlling and managing the entire supply chain of their product. Our team have witnessed the decrease in agricultural workers especially among the youths as the daily or monthly income of an average farmer could only help them live on a day-to-day basis. 

## Main Features of FarmFi 💡
FarmFi mainly focuses on the chicken farming industry in the early stages, but aims to provide the service to a wider audience in the agricultural industry.
### Supply Chain Management ⛓
With the implementation of Blockchain Technology, farmers will be able to keep track of their product on how they are refined and sold to the related customers in the particular market. This give an idea to the farmer on how much their product is worth in the market.
### Eliminate Middle Man 🕵️‍♂️
Since farmers can now manage their livestock and products, they can better understand how their product would excel and stand out in the related market. This could potentially eliminate the middle man that has been extorting most of the farmers in this day and age.
### Track Transactions 💹
